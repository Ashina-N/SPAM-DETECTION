Key skills: Machine learning, python, streamlit.
Here,we will explore the steps to collect and preprocess the data, including feature engineering and data cleaning. Next, we will implement machine learning algorithm, such as Naive Bayes and evaluate its performance.
Finally, we will deploy the trained model and test it on new data to validate its effectiveness.
